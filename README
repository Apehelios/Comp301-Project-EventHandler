Event Handler – Microservices-Based Event Booking System

Project Overview
Event Handler is a cloud-based event booking and management system developed using a microservices architecture. The project was created for the COMP301 course and demonstrates modern backend development practices such as service separation, RESTful APIs, Docker containerization, and cloud deployment.

The system allows users to register, browse events, book tickets, and complete payments. Each responsibility is handled by a separate Spring Boot service, enabling scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment.

---

System Architecture
The application is designed using a microservices approach. Each service runs independently and communicates using HTTP-based REST APIs.

Services included in the system:

* User Service: Handles user registration, authentication logic, and wallet balance management.
* Event Catalog Service: Manages event creation, listing, and event details.
* Booking Service: Handles ticket reservations and booking logic.
* Payment Service: Processes payments and deducts user balances.

Each service is implemented as a Spring Boot application and deployed separately on the cloud.

---

Cloud and Deployment
The project is deployed on Render, a cloud platform for web services.

Technologies used:

* Java 17
* Spring Boot 3.x
* PostgreSQL
* Maven
* Docker
* Render Cloud Platform

Each microservice:

* Runs as a separate Render Web Service
* Uses environment variables for configuration
* Connects to a PostgreSQL database
* Is packaged and deployed using Docker

---

Configuration
All services use environment-based configuration instead of hardcoded values.

Required environment variables:
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
DB_NAME
DB_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD

The database connection is configured dynamically using these variables, making the system suitable for cloud deployment and grading environments.

---

How the System Works

1. A user registers in the system using the User Service.
2. The user adds balance to their account.
3. Events are created and listed using the Event Catalog Service.
4. The user selects an event and creates a booking through the Booking Service.
5. The Payment Service processes the payment and deducts the required amount from the user’s balance.
6. The booking is confirmed if payment is successful.

This flow demonstrates interaction between multiple microservices.

---

Testing and Grading
The system is designed to be tested through REST API calls using tools such as Postman or curl.
Each service exposes HTTP endpoints that can be called independently.

The application does not require local database setup for grading, as all services are deployed and configured on the cloud using environment variables.

---

Docker Support
Each microservice contains its own Dockerfile.
Docker is used to:

* Build the application consistently
* Package dependencies
* Ensure the same runtime behavior across environments

This allows the instructor to redeploy or test the system in a controlled environment.

2. Deployed Microservices (Render)
----------------------------------

User Service:
https://springboot-render-app-user.onrender.com
service id:srv-d5imfe24d50c73d1q2o0

Booking Service:
https://springboot-render-app-booking.onrender.com
service id: srv-d5imjg63jp1c73f175gg

Payment Service:
https://springboot-render-app-payment.onrender.com

Event Catalog Service:
https://springboot-render-app-event.onrender.com
service id:srv-d5imfe24d50c73d1q2o0


Note:
These services expose REST APIs under the /api/* path.
Accessing the root URL (/) returns 404 by design.


3. API Testing (Postman)
-----------------------
All endpoints are designed to be tested using Postman.

Examples:
- POST /api/users/register
- POST /api/users/login
- POST /api/bookings
- POST /api/payments
- GET  /api/events

JSON is used for both request and response bodies.


4. Database (PostgreSQL on Render)
---------------------------------
Database Provider: Render Cloud PostgreSQL
External Database URL
 postgresql://apehelios:1TyKFoC76TKXVrZ6F1OtSrnjYwz8Ud5h@dpg-d5ikna75r7bs73c4i2jg-a.frankfurt-postgres.render.com/maindb_a6xf

Connection is configured using environment variables:
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
DB_NAME
DB_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD

Credentials are stored securely in Render and are not exposed in the repository.


5. Deployment Platform
----------------------
Render Cloud Platform

Render Username = Apehels

Each microservice is deployed as an independent web service,
following a cloud-based microservice architecture.
