This project implements the **User Service** microservice for the EventPlanner system.
The User Service is responsible for **user registration, authentication, and profile management**.
It is developed as an independent Spring Boot microservice following RESTful API principles.

---

## Project Overview

The User Service handles all identity-related operations within the EventPlanner application.
It allows users to create accounts, authenticate securely using JWT tokens, and manage their own profile information.
Other microservices in the system can rely on the JWT tokens generated by this service to authorize user actions.

---

## Technologies Used

- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Security  
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication  
- Spring Data JPA  
- H2 In-Memory Database (Development)  
- Maven  

---

## Running the Application

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Run the `UserServiceApplication` class
3. The application starts on the following address:
http://localhost:8080



---

## Authentication Flow

1. A user registers using the `/auth/register` endpoint  
2. The user logs in using the `/auth/login` endpoint  
3. A JWT token is returned upon successful login  
4. The JWT token must be included in the `Authorization` header to access protected endpoints  
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

## API Endpoints

- **POST** `/auth/register`  
  Registers a new user  

- **POST** `/auth/login`  
  Authenticates the user and returns a JWT token  

- **GET** `/users/me`  
  Returns the authenticated user’s profile (Protected)  

- **PUT** `/users/me`  
  Updates the authenticated user’s profile (Protected)  

---

## Security

- Spring Security is used for authentication and authorization
- JWT-based stateless authentication is implemented
- Protected endpoints cannot be accessed without a valid JWT token
- Invalid or missing tokens result in `401 Unauthorized` responses

---

## Database

- An H2 in-memory database is used during development
- User data is persisted using Spring Data JPA
- Database tables are created automatically by Hibernate

H2 Console:
http://localhost:8080/h2-console


---

## Testing

All endpoints were tested using **Postman**.

Test scenarios include:
- Successful user registration and login
- Access control with valid and invalid JWT tokens
- Profile retrieval and update operations
- Unauthorized access attempts returning proper HTTP status codes

---

## Notes

- This service is designed to be part of a microservices-based architecture
- It can be integrated with other services such as Event, Booking, and Payment services
- JWT tokens generated by this service enable secure inter-service communication
